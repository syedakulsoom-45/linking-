        <ol><li>As technology has advanced, it has significantly increased unemployment. People rely on computers for all of their tasks as well as for their survival. Because a single computer can complete a great deal of work quickly, this has also increased unemployment.</li>
        <li>In the modern world, some people are knowledgeable about technology and have become hackers, so your data isn't safe with you. They can hack your system, bank accounts, business data, and much more from the comfort of their home using the most recent technologies.

        <li>Instead of reading anything productive, they are more likely to use various unnecessary stuff. Young people, adults, and children are all involved in social media, which prevents them from completing their daily tasks. Since most children today own a laptop or a phone, they might need help to focus on their schoolwork.</li>
